            There are several tools at Rose-Hulman that present data in different ways. For example, the schedule lookup page, banner
            web, course catalogs, and moodle have data on students, faculty, courses, terms, and schedule. However, all the
            data is not collocated; thus it is challenging to perform simple analyses on the data and glean simple information
            from the collective dataset. This website brings all that data together into one collective dataset and give
            a user (e.g., department head, faculty, advisor, student) the ability to perform simple queries/analyses and
            glean important information from the collective dataset.
